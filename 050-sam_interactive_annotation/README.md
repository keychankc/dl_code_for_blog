# SAM Interactive Annotation (Full Runnable Engineering Package)

This package contains a fully runnable interactive segmentation annotation
pipeline based on Segment Anything Model (SAM).

It is designed for **engineering-level evaluation** of annotation cost vs quality,
and is directly referenced in Chapter 5 of the accompanying text.

See `data/README_DATA.md` for dataset preparation.
